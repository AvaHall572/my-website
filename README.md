# add more images 
# on your FAQ page, it seems like the font is different in the dropdown boxes compared to the rest of the website.
# One of the things that I noticed was the Boxes under the What Clients are saying tab are not quite lined up with relation to the page. It seems that they are left justified in a grid, which looks amazing on a smaller screen, but looks a bit unaligned on a desktop.
# There seems to be a broken image on the services page 
# Recommend fixing FAQ on the nav bar in the home page its spelled incorrectly
