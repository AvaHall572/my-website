# on your FAQ page, it seems like the font is different in the dropdown boxes compared to the rest of the website. 
To fix the font I changed the font family to be the same.

# One of the things that I noticed was the Boxes under the What Clients are saying tab are not quite lined up with relation to the page. It seems that they are left justified in a grid, which looks amazing on a smaller screen, but looks a bit unaligned on a desktop.
To fix the boxes under the what clients are saying tab I added CSS to remove padding and set a width to better align them on desktop screens.

# There seems to be a broken image on the services page 
I did not fix this issue as the image is not an image that works on a desktop. I am getting new images to use. 

# Recommend fixing FAQ on the nav bar in the home page its spelled incorrectly
I fixed my spelling error and saved. Now the navigation bar correctly shows "FAQ" on the home page.
