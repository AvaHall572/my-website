                <h2 class="header">All about me</h2>
                <p> With a specialization in cutting, styling, and coloring hair, I began my hairstyling journey at an
                    early age. I’ve always been drawn to the beauty industry—not just for its creativity, but for the
                    confidence and joy it brings to people. While many of my peers pursued traditional college paths, I
                    followed a different direction, one that aligned with my passion for personal expression and helping
                    others feel their best.

                    From the beginning, I knew I wanted to create a space where clients could feel comfortable, seen,
                    and empowered. My training focused on mastering modern techniques in color, design, and texture, but
                    more importantly, it taught me how to listen. I take pride in truly understanding each client’s
                    vision and bringing it to life through customized styles that suit their personality, lifestyle, and
                    goals.

                    Whether it’s a bold transformation, a soft refresh, or a detailed style for a special occasion, my
                    goal is to make every appointment a collaborative and uplifting experience. Hair isn’t just my
                    profession—it’s my passion. I love that every cut, every color, and every style tells a story, and
                    I’m honored to be part of so many.
                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I can’t wait to connect with you and help you feel your
                    absolute best—one strand at a time. </p>

            <div class="flex-item"> <!-- School -->
                <h2 class="header"> School </h2>
                <p>I attended and graduated from <a href="https://paulmitchell.edu/programs" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"> Paul Mitchell</a>, where I received extensive, hands-on training in
                    both classic and modern hair techniques. From precision cutting to advanced coloring and customized
                    styling, the program equipped me with a strong foundation in the skills every stylist needs to
                    succeed. But what truly set my education apart was the focus on client experience, professionalism,
                    and personal growth.

                    At Paul Mitchell, I learned that great hairstyling isn’t just about technique—it’s about connection,
                    communication, and confidence. We were encouraged to explore our creativity, embrace individuality,
                    and stay ahead of beauty trends through continued education and collaboration. The environment was
                    fast-paced, inspiring, and deeply supportive—exactly the kind of atmosphere I aim to recreate with
                    every client I meet.

                    The training I received helped shape not only my technical abilities but also my mindset as a
                    stylist. Today, I bring that same level of care, creativity, and attention to detail into every
                    service I offer. Whether it’s a classic look or a bold transformation, I approach each appointment
                    with the same goal: to help my clients leave feeling confident, empowered, and absolutely beautiful.
