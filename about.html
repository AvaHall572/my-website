            <p> With a specialization in cutting, styling, and coloring hair, I began my hairstyling journey early on, pursuing a career that aligned with my passion for creativity and personal expression, rather than a traditional college path. </p>

            <p> I attended and graduated from <a href="https://paulmitchell.edu/programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Paul Mitchell</a>, where I received extensive training in both classic and modern hair techniques. My education focused not only on technical skills like cutting, coloring, and styling, but also on client care, professionalism, and creativity. Paul Mitchell's rigorous program prepared me to deliver high-quality, customized services while staying up to date with the latest trends in the beauty industry.</p>
