                <p> With a specialization in cutting, styling, and coloring hair, I began my hairstyling journey early
                    on, pursuing a career that aligned with my passion for creativity and personal expression, rather
                    than a traditional college path. </p>

            <div class="flex-item"> <!-- School -->
                <h2 class="header"> School </h2>
                <p> I attended and graduated from <a href="https://paulmitchell.edu/programs" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"> Paul Mitchell</a>, where I received extensive training in both
                    classic and modern hair techniques. My education focused not only on technical skills like cutting,
                    coloring, and styling, but also on client care, professionalism, and creativity. Paul Mitchell's
                    rigorous program prepared me to deliver high-quality, customized services while staying up to date
                    with the latest trends in the beauty industry.</p>
